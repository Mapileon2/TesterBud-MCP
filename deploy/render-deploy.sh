# Script for deploying to Render

# Ensure you have logged in to Render CLI: render login

# Replace with your actual Render service name and region if needed
SERVICE_NAME="TesterBud"
REGION="us-east-1" # Example region

echo "Deploying to Render service: $SERVICE_NAME"

# You would typically push your code to a Git repository that Render monitors.
# This script assumes you have a Git repository set up and are ready to push.
# If you are not using Git, you might need to manually upload your code or use Render's API.

# Example: Add and commit changes
# git add .
# git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"

# Example: Push to your Git repository (e.g., main branch)
# git push origin main

# Render will automatically detect the push and start the build process based on render.yaml.
# You can monitor the deployment progress via the Render dashboard or Render CLI.

echo "Push your code to your Git repository to trigger deployment on Render."
echo "Monitor deployment status on the Render dashboard or using 'render ps --service $SERVICE_NAME'."

# Example of checking deployment status (optional)
# render ps --service $SERVICE_NAME
